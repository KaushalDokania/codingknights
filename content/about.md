Dear readers, Welcome to CodingKnights.
### Who am I?
My name is Kaushal Dokania and I'm the founder of this blog. I live in Bengaluru and currently I'm working as a Software Developer at Micro Focus.

### About this blog
This is a computer science and technology related blog where I write about programming languages, Software development and related tools and technologies.

I am passionate about Software and like to share my knowledge with people. This is why I have started this blog, where I can organize my thoughts in one place and share learnings from my daily job as a Software Developer. Writing a blog post requires me to do some prior research and therefore this blog also helps me in improving my overall knowledge.

### Who is this blog for?
Anyone who is either in the Software industry or interested in learning about programming and related technologies should read my blog.

### My Blogging goals
This is my first ever blog and I am very excited to take this far. I have following goals from this blog
- To create a good collection of precise, useful and informative articles
- To post new articles frequently
- To build here, a small(as of now üòÑ) community of my own readers.

### How to connect with me?
You can connect with me through any of my social profiles available on this website. You can also write to me at kausahldokania12@gmail.com. I am open to feedback/ advice and will be happy to answer your queries.


Thank you for reading.
